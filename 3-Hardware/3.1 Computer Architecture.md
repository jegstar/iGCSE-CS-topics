## What is a Core?

In the last lessons we looked at [Little Man Computer](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/) which is a model of a basic computer. Little Man Computer is a model of a very old simple CPU. Modern CPUs are vastly improved and have much more functionality. Little Man Computer was capable of doing one thing at one time, as it only had one set of registers, one ALU and so on. A core is a separate set of all of these things in a single processor.

Each element labelled "Core X" in the diagram above represents a processing unit. As you can also see from this diagram, all of the cores in this chip share the same main memory. The architecture above is called a quad core architecture as it has four cores in it. Modern computers may have up to 18 cores, but these are normally used for specific, processing-heavy use cases.

Because the cores are separate they can perform multiple tasks at once. In the chip architecture shown, a quad-core architecture, the processor is capable of running four tasks simultaneously. 

Alternatively, large tasks can be broken down into separate parts and the processor can approach each part of the task separately and then recombine them, a process called parallel computing. 

Also to note is the cache available to each core, leading to the question.

## What is cache?

CPU cache is another type of memory. In Little Man Computer we loaded everything from the RAM, but that is not strictly speaking true. Modern CPUs are incredibly fast, approximately 10-100 times faster than RAM. This means that if every instruction had to be loaded from the RAM, the CPU would spend most of its time waiting for instructions creating a bottleneck. To get around this problem we used cache, a type of memory that is typically located in the processor itself to keep instructions that are being worked on right now. 

[This video](https://youtu.be/yi0FhRqDJfo) gives a very clear description of both cache and the different levels.
